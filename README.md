## Setup and Provision your ubuntu development environment.

This is my setup, it may not work for you. Feel free to modify appropriately.

## Setup       
      
* git clone this project
* cd into this project's directory
* edit vars/base.yml with the values you want
* . setup.sh
* go make a cup of coffee, this may take a while
* your dev environment is ready


## NB:      
* This project was tested on a machine running ubuntu 14.04, 64bit.
* However, It should work for most debian machines. 
* Some tasks will fail for 32bit machines.

* You can direct any questions, suggestions etc to:

## TODO:
* make it more generic
* fix as many of the tasks whose errors I'm ignoring as possible.
